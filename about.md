Hi, I'm **Mathieu Rousse**, a cybersecurity engineer, builder, and perpetual learner currently serving as **Head of Engineering** at **[Escape](https://escape.tech)**.

### What I do

- Lead a distributed engineering org focused on API security, platform reliability, and developer experience.
- Previously co‑founded **Hopserve**, a cloud‑native security startup, after several years building the Synthetics product at **Datadog**.
- Regular visitor at BSides, LeHack, and other security meet‑ups; occasional CTF medalist.

### Why I do it

I wrote my first line of code at 12 while fixing a “broken” PC my father refused to repair for me. That spark of curiosity never left. Today I help teams ship fast **and** safe software because security should accelerate and not slow innovation.

### Beyond the terminal

Music keeps me grounded: I’ve played everything from metal guitar to jazz bass, and according to Spotify I now spend nearly half my waking hours listening to music. When I’m not at a keyboard, you’ll find me chasing light with my camera, cycling along French back‑roads, or brewing beer.

See you around,

MR
