  <h1 class="title">My setup</h1>

  <p class="title-date"><small class="text-muted">Apr 6, 2016</small></p>

  <p>I have spend many hours on the internet, discovering new technologies and comparing them to understand their assets and how they could help me on my projects.</p>

<p>During one of those explorations, I found <a href="https://usesthis.com">usethis.com</a>, a website which to answer the question “What do people use to get stuff done?”.</p>

<!---excerpt-break-->
<p>I found a lot of great products and wanted to share mine as a student. A few years after I start working, I will update this.</p>

<h3 id="who-are-you-and-what-do-you-do">Who are you, and what do you do?</h3>
<p>I am Mathieu Rousse, a student in micro-electronics and computer sciences at the École des Mines de Saint-Étienne campus Provence, near Marseille in the south of France. This is a very broad subject and I have decided to focus more on the security side of it. So I will be doing my third year at Télécom SudParis school in the south-east of Paris. I will be studying network security and software security there.</p>

<p>During the next 5 months, I will be working as intern on a high-performance computing framework using OpenCL and CUDA to analyze ultrasound data.</p>

<p>When I was 15 years old I discovered what were linux, a server, and how a misconfigured LDAP server could compromise all accounts from my accounts. At that point I also discovered what were the consequences of accessing a system I was not supposed to.</p>

<p>It was at this point I knew I would study security later. I kept practicing security since then and built my own lab. Eventually during LAN Parties I would try some new techniques when a game I already lost took too much time to end. (My very first DoS).</p>

<p>So I write programs, experiment server configurations, try to crack the crackmes and attend security conferences as much as I can.</p>

<h3 id="what-hardware-do-you-use">What hardware do you use?</h3>

<p>I have had the occasion to put my hands over a lot of hardware since I started. I played with several Cisco <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/switches/ps628/ps3821/index.html">C2950</a>, <a href="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/switches/ps646/products_data_sheet09186a00800913d0.html">C3550</a> and <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/switches/catalyst-2960-series-switches/prod_bulletin0900aecd80322c22.html">C2960</a>, all 48 ports. They were useless for a daily use, but handsome during LAN Party.</p>

<p>My everyday computer is a MSI laptop with a 15” i7 2.5GHz quad-core and 16G of RAM. I added 240G of SSD to complements its terabyte HDD. It is a little too powerful for my everyday use.</p>

<p>My personal Server is hosted by <a href="http://www.kimsufi.com/en/servers.xml">Kimsufi</a> (OVH) in Canada, it has two gigs of ram and two threads at 1.86GHz for a 500G storage. It is more than enough to handle every experiments I may want to conduct.</p>

<p>My phone is a <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_one-6327.php">OnePlus One</a> I bought by chance because a friend had an invite about to expire. It is surprisingly fluid and powerful. As for my laptop, it is maybe a little too powerful for what I using it for.</p>

<p>I also have a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-b/">Raspberry Pi 1 version B</a>. It is a very good toy, but lacks bluetooth/wifi by default and sometimes freezes when used as a network router.</p>

<p>I bought a <a href="http://www.hercules.com/us/dj-speakers/bdd/p/172/xps-2-0-80-dj-monitor/">Hercules XPS DJ Monitor</a> set for my desk. It has dramatically changed the way I listen to music while working. They where quite expensive (80€) but they are absolutely perfect for my ears.</p>

<h3 id="what-software-do-you-use">What software do you use?</h3>

<p>My laptop runs with a dualboot Windows 8.1 (for work reasons, I had to downgrade from Win 10) with Debian 8. I worked during 6 years with <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/">Archlinux</a>, which IS an excellent distribution. I chose to change in order to gain more experience with Debian.</p>

<p>My server is running under Archlinux since 2012. It runs my mails, web hosting (apache/mysql/php), my versionning (<a href="https://gogs.io/">Gogs</a>), and an <a href="https://owncloud.org/">owncloud</a> instance that hosts my calendar, contacts and to share/backup files.</p>

<p>My phone runs under <a href="https://download.cyanogenmod.org/?device=bacon">CyanogenMod 13</a>, freshly installed. I had to reset it recently, and I decided not to download many useless apps. The main apps I use are Twitter, Whatsapp and Airdroid.
I installed <a href="https://f-droid.org/">F-Droid</a> to have access to open-source apps, where I got <a href="https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=k-9&amp;fdid=com.fsck.k9">K-9 Mail</a>, a cute mail client and the most important one : <a href="https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=davdroid&amp;fdid=at.bitfire.davdroid">DAVDroid</a>. It allows me to synchronize my contacts and agenda with my owncloud server.</p>

<p>I use daily <a href="http://keepass.info/">Keepass</a> to store all my passwords, Firefox, Thunderbird and the freshly installed <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom.io</a> as a text editor.</p>

<p>I am addicted to the Office Suite as it easily produce beautiful documents. I abuse OneNote synced with my phone to store every tasks and ideas I have.</p>

<p>And lastly, I use VirtualBox to launch my various virtual machines.</p>

<h3 id="what-would-be-your-dream-setup">What would be your dream setup</h3>

<p>My Raspberry Pi 1b lacks native WiFi/Bluetooth, which makes me connect two USB dongles which draws a lot of current and occupies the two USB ports. I would love to switch to a Raspberry Pi 3, first to be able to realize a network toolkit : I developed a simple application to connect to my RasPi over bluetooth with my phone, from which I can set a “mode” (Bridged AP, routed AP, MitM bridged with a USB-RJ45, capture over eth0, automated WiFi discovery/pentest, …).</p>

<p>The Office Suite being the most important thing that keeps me from having a full GNU/Linux computer, I need to learn LaTeX.</p>

<p>I finally set up my VPN to connect every gadget to an unique network where I could host my experiments and personal services. What I do lack now is a backup in the cloud. I spent a lot of time reading how the cloud could the best solution to store my backups, but I still am reluctant now. Having my files available with owncloud makes me confortable as I can get then whenever I want and I do know where they are stored. But with this setup, I can’t replicate them safely. After reading Daniel Miessler blog post <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/blog/backups-cloud/">“Why should you start backing up to the cloud”</a>, I seriously considered moving my backups to the cloud. Now, all I need is to “Just do it”.</p>
