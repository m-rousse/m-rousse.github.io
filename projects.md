I do not have many projects to show at the moment but might update this list one day.

Here are some sites that I worked on :

- [Gomines](https://github.com/Minitel-Ismin/Gomines)
- [Minitel](http://minitel.emse.fr/): It is the presentation site of the association managing the network of the residence of my school, which I founded in November 2015. The whole website has been written by me. *(Bootstrap, jQuery, Typed.js)*
- [Incipio](https://github.com/m-rousse/Incipio): It is an ERP (Enterprise Resources Planning) conceived especially for Junior Entreprises, associations of students offering consulting services to the market. *(Symfony)*
- [MyIsmin](http://myismin.emse.fr/): This is the presentation site of the associations and clubs of my school. *(jekyll, bootstrap)*
- [PepSound](https://web.archive.org/web/20170612085158/http://pepsound.fr/): Worked on the backoffice, calendar and music player. *(HTML5, jQuery)* _Not live anymore_
- [Citadingue](https://lecitadingue.com/): Helped integrating the design in HTML/CSS/JS from mockups the client gave us. *(bootstrap)*

- [My Blog](https://math.rousse.me/): This blog where I present ideas and techniques that I did not find easily or that are interesting. *(jekyll, grunt, sass, jQuery, bootstrap)*

I also worked on some non-web projects:
- [TwoFAuth](https://github.com/m-rousse/2fauth): Application to have my 2FA tokens on my phone, I stopped working on it once I discovered [FreeOTP](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fedorahosted.freeotp/)
- [BluePi](/projects/bluepi.html): This project aims at providing me a quick way to control a system using my phone through Bluetooth. (_Paused_)
