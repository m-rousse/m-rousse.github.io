I have several projects ongoing at the moment :

- [TwoFAuth](https://github.com/m-rousse/2fauth)
- [Gomines](https://github.com/Minitel-Ismin/Gomines)
- [BluePi](/projects/bluepi)

Here are some sites that I helped develop :

- [Minitel](http://minitel.emse.fr/) : It is the presentation site of the association managing the network of the residence of my school, which I founded in November 2015. The whole website has been written by me.
- [Incipio](https://github.com/m-rousse/Incipio) : It is an ERP (Enterprise Resources Planning) conceived especially for Junior Entreprises, associations of students offering consulting services to the market.
- [MyIsmin](http://myismin.emse.fr/) : This is the presentation site of the associations and clubs of my school.
